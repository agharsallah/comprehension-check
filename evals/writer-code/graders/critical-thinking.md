The reply is a JSON object whose `questions` array is a quiz about a 5-minute in-memory price cache
added to `getPrice`.

PASS if the questions make the user reason (predict an outcome, weigh a trade-off, find what a
check misses, judge a risk or decision) rather than recall, AND at least one question is about
a decision behind the change that the user did not ask for: the 5-minute TTL, caching in process
memory, no invalidation on price change, an unbounded Map, or letting checkout read the cache.

FAIL if any question is trivia (a variable name, syntax, a line count), if none touches a
decision the user did not ask for, or if there is no JSON object with `questions`.
