// The settings menu, as /config works: a list of the settings with their
// values; ↑↓ moves, Enter changes the one picked in place, and the list comes
// back with the new value until Esc. Quiz on, Sound, Length and Wording switch on
// Enter; Max questions asks for a number; a setting with `choices`
// (Perspective) lists them to pick from. Each dialog is a plain `$.ui.ask`.
//
// A dialog holds at most 4 options, so past 4 settings the list comes in
// pages (`menuPages`): 3 settings and "More settings…", the last page with
// "Back" to the first.
