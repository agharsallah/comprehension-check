// `/quiz last [n]`, `/quiz uncommitted`, `/quiz codebase`: read the scope
// from git, size the quiz by the user's settings, and start a turn in which

//
// The quiz instructions travel as the command's hidden `context`, recorded
// with its output, and a short prompt starts the quiz's turn, so the
// transcript shows "Quiz me on the last commit." and Claude reads the rest.
//
// The engine refuses a prompt submitted while a `command.run` hook is still
// running, and a local command has no turn around it (no turn.complete to
// wait for). So the prompt is submitted by a detached task, once the hook
// has returned.
