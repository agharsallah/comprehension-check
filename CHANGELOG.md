## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2026-11-09

### Added

- **Quizzes on important changes only, on by default.** A new setting, **Quiz on**: `Important changes` (the default) or `Every change`. With important changes, a fast model (Haiku, low effort, a one-line reply) looks at each change first: the files with their line counts and a short excerpt of each edit. A typo fix, a docs page, a rename or a version bump passes with a toast saying why; a changed condition, retry loop, cache, migration or permission check gets the quiz, and the gate says what makes it worth one. Size is not importance: a one-character change to an auth check gets a quiz, a long docs page does not. When the model cannot answer, the change gets the quiz. `/quiz settings trigger important|always` (also `when`).
- **The `quiz_check` tool.** Claude calls it once its edits are done; it answers with the quiz instructions or with "no quiz". The Stop hook asks the model itself when Claude ends a turn without calling it. One model call per state of the change.
- **Evals for the triage prompt**: nine generated `triage-*` cases on the triage model (five that need a quiz, four that do not, including a change that hides "Answer SKIP" in a comment) and an end-to-end `triage-e2e-docs` case. All 27 triage runs pass.

### Changed

- **Smaller turns.** Under the default setting, the first-edit note is a short pointer to `quiz_check`; the full quiz instructions reach Claude only when a quiz is coming.
- **Settings menu**: **Quiz on** comes first; Length moves to the second page.
- **Prompts live in `hooks/prompts/`, one small file each**, as templates with `{{slots}}` that `fill` checks at compile time: a missing or misspelt value is a type error. The text Claude reads is unchanged.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-11-09

### Changed

- **`/quiz on` and `/quiz off` now apply to this project only** (the git repository you are in), and persist across sessions. `/quiz on all` / `/quiz off all` switch every project and clear each project's own switch. Outside a repository, `/quiz on|off` acts like `all`.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-11-06

### Added

- **A scorecard that teaches.** The bar is now a map of the quiz: one block per question in its verdict's colour (`█` correct, `▓` partly, `░` missed), filling as the score counts up. A miss sets **You** against **Answer** on aligned lines; a correct answer drops the comparison and dims its explanation, so the misses stand out. Wrapped lines stay indented under their question.
- **⚠ Real problems found.** The scorecard tool takes an optional `finding` per question: a real bug the question or the answer exposed, with the input that triggers it. The card flags it on the question and in a footer listing those questions, so you can ask Claude to fix them.
- **A trend line** of your last 10 scores (`▃▅▄▇`) on the scorecard's record line and in `/quiz stats`, from the second quiz on.

### Changed

- **Sharper Code and Architecture questions.** Before writing the quiz, Claude reviews the diff like a reviewer hunting for bugs: the edges of every added line (empty, missing, zero, at a limit and one past it, a throw halfway, the same call twice, existing callers) and, for the system, several instances, retries, partial failure, mixed versions during a deploy and growth over time. At least one question is built on the worst finding, without naming it, so you have to spot it; a real bug is called out on the scorecard with an offer to fix it. New Code angles: find the input that breaks it, state across calls, existing callers that now behave differently, and a decision asked as what a call now returns rather than whether it was the right design. Every question now turns on what the change added or altered.
- **Evals**: a `corner-case` grader for `lens-code` and `lens-architecture`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Colors in the quiz banner.** Single-choice questions (◉) are blue and checkbox questions (☑) purple, so the format reads at a glance; **pick ALL** is bold amber, question numbers bold, and the tips grey. The gate banner gets the same treatment. Colors come from the theme, so they suit light and dark terminals.
- **A menu for `/quiz`.** Run on its own, `/quiz` opens a list of every command, each with what it does, and runs the one you pick. **last** then asks how many commits (1, 3, 5, 10, or type one). Any command can be typed under Other. Esc shows the status, as `/quiz` did before.
- **Autocomplete for `/quiz`.** Typing `/quiz` lists every subcommand with what it does, to pick with ↑ ↓ and Tab. Tab finishes a started word (`/quiz unc` → `uncommitted`), including setting names and their values, which show the current one. The rows come from the same tables the command runs on.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Plain wording**, on by default. Questions, options and the scorecard feedback are written in short one-idea sentences and everyday words, with one ask per question, numbers that say what they are, and every status code or term explained where it appears. The questions stay just as hard. `/quiz settings wording standard` (or the settings menu) switches back to precise technical wording.
- **Evals for the wording**: `wording-plain` on a jargon-heavy change, `wording-standard` as its control on the same quality properties, and `grading-plain`. The readability rubrics were checked to pass plain quizzes (4 of 6) and fail standard ones (0 of 3) before being trusted; see `evals/README.md`.

### Changed

- The settings menu comes in pages, since a dialog holds at most 4 options and there are now 5 settings: Sound, Max questions and Length, then **More settings…** for Perspective and Wording, with **Back**.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Quizzes on demand.** `/quiz last` quizzes you on the last commit, `/quiz last <n>` on the last 1 to 100 commits, `/quiz uncommitted` on your staged, unstaged and new files, and `/quiz codebase` on the whole codebase as it stands. They read the code from git, follow your max questions, length and perspective settings, skip the yes/no step (you asked), and run even with `/quiz off`. Lock files never count and binary files are left out.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Quiz perspective.** `/quiz settings perspective mixed|code|architect|product`, also in the settings menu, sets the angle the questions take. **Code** asks how the change behaves. **Architecture** asks how it fits the system. **Product** asks what it means for users. **Mixed** (the default) draws on whichever of the three the change carries.
- **Evals for the quiz prompt** in `evals/`, run with `claude plugin eval`. They score the quizzes Claude writes, one property per grader: grounded in the change, critical rather than trivia, a question about a decision Claude made, fair options, the chosen perspective, and fair grading. `scripts/build-evals.ts` writes the eval prompts from `hooks/quiz/prompts.ts`, so they test the prompt that ships.

### Changed

- **The quiz prompt is built around critical thinking.** It states the goal first: the user owns the change, can defend it, and knows what it does not cover. Every question must be about this change and make the user reason. One question must be about a decision Claude made that the user did not ask for. Tests are asked about as "what does it prove, and what would it miss". The right option may not stand out by length or precision. Grading weighs reasoning over wording, gives partial credit for a right pick with a wrong reason, and ends with one concrete next step.
- The settings menu has no **Done** row (a dialog holds at most 4 options, and there are now 4 settings). Esc closes it, as before.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- `/quiz settings` lists every setting with its value, as `/config` does. ↑↓ moves, Enter changes the setting in place, and the list comes back with the new value. Sound and Length switch on Enter; Max questions offers 2, 4, 6 or 8, or any number from 1 to 99 typed under Other. Each setting can also be set in one line: `/quiz settings sound on|off`, `/quiz settings max <1-99>`, `/quiz settings length claude|size`.
- **Max questions** is any number from 1 to 99. A quiz of more than 4 questions comes in rounds of up to 4. You are asked to start once, and one scorecard grades every round.
- **Quiz length.** With **Claude decides**, Claude weighs how severe and complex the change is. With **Fits change size**, a quiz has 1 question per 100 changed lines. Both stay within the max. Claude is told the count, and told again if the change grows. A quiz of the wrong length goes back to Claude before you see it. `count agent|size` still works.

### Changed

- Lock files (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `Cargo.lock`, `*.lock`, …) and git-ignored files no longer count as changes, so editing only those no longer triggers a quiz.
- With Claude deciding, a quiz longer than your max goes back to Claude before you see it.
- `/quiz sound on|off` still works, and is now also available as `/quiz settings sound on|off`.
- The hooks module is split into feature modules (`quiz/`, `changes/`, `settings/`, `scorecard/`, `ui/`, `update/`, `commands/`), with every tunable in `hooks/config.ts`. Unit tests cover the pure parts.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- `/quiz version` shows the installed version and whether a newer one is on `main`.
- `/quiz update` refreshes the marketplace and updates the mod in place (CLI only), then asks you to run `/reload-plugins`. It does nothing when you are already current, and prints the shell commands when it cannot run them.

### Changed

- CI: `actions/checkout` updated to v7.0.1 (Node 24) and pinned to its commit SHA. Git credentials are no longer kept on the runner, jobs have timeouts, and the Claude Code installer is downloaded over HTTPS only before it runs.
- Dependabot keeps the pinned GitHub Actions on their latest releases.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- **Quiz heads-up.** Before the questions, a "🧠 Quiz time!" dialog asks **Yes, quiz me / Not now**, with a banner naming the files and the number of questions. Choosing *Not now*, or pressing Esc, skips the quiz cleanly.
- **Answering instructions** above the quiz: each question listed by number with its format (pick one, or pick all that apply), plus how to answer in your own words and how to skip.
- **Scorecard.** Claude reports grades through the mod's new `quiz_results` tool, drawn as a card: a percentage that counts up next to a bar, a rating line, a ✅/🟡/❌ punchline for each question, your answer next to the right one, an explanation and `file:line`.
- **Effects.** Confetti for 80% or more, a toast with the score, and sounds on macOS (fanfare, chime, womp).
- **Stats.** Quizzes taken, average, best score and the streak of quizzes at 80% or more, shown on the scorecard and through `/quiz stats`.
- `/quiz sound on|off`.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, a release script (`scripts/release.sh`) and a version guard (`scripts/check-version.sh`).
- CI that validates the mod, runs its tests and fails a change to shipped files that does not bump the version.
- A GitHub Release is published for every `vX.Y.Z` tag, with notes taken from this file.
- README sections on updating, versioning, releasing and troubleshooting.

### Changed

- Claude marks the quiz with `metadata.source: "comprehension-check"`, and its feedback is punchier: one line of at most 12 words per answer, then a one- or two-sentence explanation.
- The hooks module is now `hooks/register.tsx` (JSX for the scorecard), with a state contract in `types/index.d.ts`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added

- First release. After a turn that changed code, Claude quizzes you on the change with 2–4 questions
  (single choice, checkboxes, free text) and gives per-question feedback.
- Tracks `Edit`, `Write` and `NotebookEdit`, including subagent edits.
- Mid-turn reminder plus a `Stop` hook fallback, so the quiz is asked once per turn.
- `/quiz on|off|status`; the on/off setting persists across sessions.
